# Quick start repository

This repository houses a simple set up that I am planning to use to build simple 
desktop apps with elm, typescript, electron, python and any other languages.
The idea is to separate the program into two parts. A GUI side, written in 
elm, typescript and electron, which provides the view, and a kernel side, which
does the proverbial heavy lifting. This kernel side could be implemented in
python, or any other language with which there exists some interop with javascript.

The main idea is to be able to use webdevelopment tools to build GUIs, while still
keeping some of the performance of proper desktop applications. I do not have the 
illusion that I am an experienced web developer, so use this set-up on your own risk.
Chances are I made some big no-nos while setting up. I hope to resolve some of these
no-nos in the feature.
